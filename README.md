# Shape Math Quiz Game

## Overview

The Shape Math Quiz Game is an interactive web application designed to help users practice geometry calculations involving rectangles, squares, and triangles. The game presents various problems related to area (A) and perimeter (P) calculations, with different levels of complexity.

## Features

- **Multiple Shape Support**: Practice with rectangles, squares, and triangles
- **Diverse Question Types**:
  - Standard area/perimeter calculations
  - Reverse calculations (find dimensions given area/perimeter)
  - Special calculations (find area from perimeter or diagonal)
  - Combined problems (find both length and width given area and perimeter)
- **Visual Aids**: SVG drawings of shapes with dimension indicators
- **Timed Challenges**: 20-second timer for each question
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of correct answers
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes

## Question Types

### For Rectangles:
1. Calculate area or perimeter from dimensions
2. Find length or width given area or perimeter
3. Calculate area from perimeter (and vice versa)
4. Find both length and width given both area and perimeter

### For Squares:
1. Calculate area or perimeter from side length
2. Find side length given area or perimeter
3. Calculate area from perimeter (and vice versa)
4. Calculate area from diagonal length

### For Triangles:
1. Calculate area from base and height
2. Find base or height given area

## How to Play

1. Select a shape from the dropdown menu
2. Read the question displayed
3. Examine the shape drawing (some dimensions may be hidden)
4. Enter your answer in the input field
   - For "find both length and width" questions, enter values separated by a comma (e.g., "5, 8")
5. Press Enter or click Submit to check your answer
6. The game continues with new questions until time runs out or an incorrect answer is given
